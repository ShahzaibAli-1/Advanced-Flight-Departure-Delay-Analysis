## ✈️ **Introduction**

🚀 Flight delays pose a significant challenge to the aviation industry, affecting operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and resource management.  
This project leverages machine learning to analyze and predict departure delays, utilizing flight details, weather information, and delay records to uncover key patterns and build predictive models. 🚀

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**

### Goals of the Project:
1. 🔍 **Data Analysis**: Preprocess flight and weather data to uncover patterns influencing delays.
2. 🧠 **Model Training**:
   - **Binary Classification**: On-time vs. Delayed.
   - **Multi-class Classification**: Categorize delays into no delay, short, moderate, and long delays.
   - **Regression**: Predict exact delay durations.
3. 📊 **Model Evaluation**: Use standard metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
4. 🔧 **Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation for better performance.
5. ✨ **Testing & Submission**: Test on unseen data and submit results to Kaggle for evaluation. 🌍

## 🛠️ **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**

### 📂 **Data Integration**

🌌 **Dataset Overview**:
- **Flight Data**: Includes schedules, delays, and metadata.
- **Weather Data**: Captures weather conditions at airports. 🌦️

### 🔄 **Data Cleaning and Transformation**

**Steps Taken**:
1. 🌟 **Handle Missing Values**:
   - Impute missing weather data using statistical methods (e.g., mean, forward fill).
   - Discard flight records missing key information.

2. 🕒 **Standardize Time Fields**:
   - Convert scheduled, actual, and estimated times into a consistent datetime format.

3. 🛫 **Feature Engineering**:
   - Calculate departure delays as the difference between actual and scheduled times.
   - Merge weather data into the flight dataset, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
   - Extract **temporal features**:
     - Day of the week.
     - Hour of the day.
     - Month of the year. 🗓️

## 📈 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### 🔍 **Visualizations**

**Key Insights Through Visuals**:
1. 📊 **Delay Distributions**:
   - Histograms reveal skewness in delay durations and common delay ranges.
2. 📅 **Temporal Analysis**:
   - Line plots display delays over hours, days, and months.
3. 🛫 **Category-Wise Analysis**:
   - Bar charts compare delays across airlines, airports, and flight statuses. ✈️

### 🎯 **Correlation Analysis**

🔗 **Correlation Metrics**:
- Scatter plots and heatmaps visualize relationships between weather factors (e.g., wind speed) and delays.
- 📈 Correlation coefficients quantify dependencies.
