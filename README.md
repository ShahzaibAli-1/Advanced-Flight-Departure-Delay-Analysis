# 🌟 **Advanced Flight Departure Delay Analysis** 🌟

---

## ✈️ **Introduction**

🚀 Flight delays pose a significant challenge to the aviation industry, affecting operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and resource management. This project aims to analyze and predict flight departure delays using machine learning models. The provided datasets include flight details, weather information, and delay records, enabling a comprehensive analysis of factors influencing delays and the development of predictive models. 🚀

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**

1. 🔍 Analyze and preprocess flight and weather data to uncover patterns influencing delays.

2. 🧠 Train predictive models for:

   - **Binary classification**: On-time vs. Delayed.

   - **Multi-class classification**: No delay, short, moderate, and long delays.

   - **Regression**: Predicting exact delay durations.

3. 📊 Evaluate models using performance metrics.

4. 🔧 Optimize models using hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

5. ✨ Test the models on unseen data and submit predictions to Kaggle for evaluation. 🌍

## 🛠️ **1. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**

### 📂 **1.1 Data Integration**

🌌 The project integrates multiple datasets:

- **Flight Data**: Contains flight schedules and delays.

- **Weather Data**: Provides weather conditions at airports. 🌦️

### 🔄 **1.2 Data Cleaning and Transformation**

1. **Handle Missing Values**:

   - 🌟 Missing weather data imputed using mean or forward fill methods.

   - 🗂️ Flight records with incomplete key information are discarded.

2. **Standardize Time Fields**:

   - 🕒 Convert scheduled, actual, and estimated times into a uniform datetime format.

3. **Feature Engineering**:

   - 🛫 **Calculate Delay**: Compute departure delays as the difference between actual and scheduled times.

   - 🌤️ **Merge Weather Data**: Incorporate weather features like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

   - ⏳ **Extract Temporal Features**:

     - Day of the week.

     - Hour of the day.

     - Month of the year. 🗓️

## 📈 **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### 🔍 **2.1 Visualizations**

📊 **Delay Distributions**:

   - Histograms display delay durations, revealing skewness and common delay ranges.

📅 **Temporal Analysis**:

   - Line plots show delay trends across hours, days, and months.

🛫 **Category-Wise Analysis**:

   - Bar charts compare delays by airline, departure airport, and flight status. ✈️

### 🎯 **2.2 Correlation Analysis**

- 🔗 Scatter plots and heatmaps illustrate the relationship between weather variables (e.g., wind speed) and delays.

- 📈 Correlation coefficients quantify the strength of these relationships.

**Models Used**:

1. 🧮 Logistic Regression.

2. 🌲 Decision Trees.

3. 🌳 Random Forests.

4. 🎯 Support Vector Machines (SVM).

**Evaluation Metrics**:

- ✅ Accuracy.

- 📊 Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

- 🧾 Confusion matrix.
